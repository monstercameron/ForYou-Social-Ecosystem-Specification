# ForYou Social Network Specification

**Domain:** [foryousocial.network](https://foryousocial.network)  
*The digital home for a personalized, decentralized experience.*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The **ForYou Social Network** is a decentralized social ecosystem built on a modern void‑casting model. Users post content into a global “void” where sophisticated AI crawls and surfaces relevant posts much like a personalized public timeline. Every piece of content is released under a public domain license.

Key highlights include:

- **Micropayment-Driven Operations:**  
  Posting, archival retrieval, and ad submissions are processed via on‑chain micropayments (Bitcoin and Ethereum only). Notably, users pay a fee to retrieve archived posts—a mechanism that helps fund and sustain Heritage servers.

- **Decentralized Architecture:**  
  The network uses IPFS‑style addressing, sharding, and multi‑layer caching to optimize content propagation without centralized control. Actual file hosting remains off‑chain.

- **Community Governance:**  
  The **ForYou Federation** manages protocol upgrades, fee policies, and legal compliance via transparent, democratic processes.

- **Ad Messages with Higher Fees:**  
  Advertisement messages incorporate additional metadata (exceeding standard size limits) and therefore incur higher fees. These fees help drive network momentum and fund operations while ensuring the platform remains independent of advertiser control.

- **Scalability & Reliability:**  
  Techniques such as dynamic fee adjustments, automated failover, and regional optimization ensure that the network remains resilient and high‑performance.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1. Void‑Casting Content Flow
- **Decentralized Posting:**  
  Users publish posts into a global digital “void” without a central authority.
- **AI‑Driven Discovery:**  
  AI agents continuously scan the void to surface personalized content for users.
- **Democratic Visibility:**  
  Content discovery is based on algorithmic relevance rather than centralized curation.

### 2.2. Technical Foundation
- **Content Addressing:**  
  All posts are assigned unique hash‑based identifiers (similar to IPFS URIs) for deduplication and verification.
- **Sharding & Caching:**  
  Data is sharded and cached at multiple levels to reduce latency and ensure fast propagation across regions.
- **No On‑Chain File Storage:**  
  The network only indexes references and metadata; large files remain off‑chain.

---

## 3. Key Entities

### 3.1. ForYou Network (Protocol Layer)
- **Purpose:**  
  Facilitates decentralized content posting, indexing, and AI‑based discovery.
- **Mechanisms:**  
  Uses BTC/ETH micropayments for posting, metadata validation, and content integrity.

### 3.2. ForYou Federation (Governance Layer)
- **Role:**  
  A community‑driven body overseeing protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, and compliance.
- **Principles:**  
  Decisions are made transparently via on‑chain or hybrid off‑chain voting, with open membership to developers, node operators, and community stakeholders.

### 3.3. ForYou Heritage (Archival & Preservation Layer)
- **Role:**  
  Responsible for the long‑term archival of post references and metadata.
- **Retrieval Fee Model:**  
  Users who wish to access archived posts pay a micropayment fee. These funds directly support the operation and maintenance of Heritage servers, ensuring historical content remains accessible.

---

## 4. Node Architecture and Roles

The network relies on specialized nodes, each serving a distinct purpose:

### 4.1. Heritage Nodes (Archival Nodes)
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Securely store and preserve historical content references.  
  - Manage retrieval fee collection and ensure data integrity over time.

### 4.2. Flow Nodes (Relay Nodes)
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Rapidly propagate new posts and content updates across the network.  
  - Maintain regional caches to ensure efficient content delivery.

### 4.3. ForYou Bridge (Cross‑Chain Payment Nodes)
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Validate BTC/ETH micropayment transactions referenced in messages.  
  - Batch payments and standardize payment data for use across the ecosystem.

---

## 5. Message Schema Specifications

Every network message is a JSON object that includes metadata, optional content, and a digital signature referencing a valid on‑chain transaction.

### 5.1. Base Message Structure

```json
{
  "id": "unique-message-id",
  "author": "user-public-key-or-alias",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-09T12:00:00Z",

    "amount": "payment-amount",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-09T11:59:55Z"
  },
  "signature": "digital-signature"
}
```

- **id:** Unique identifier (e.g., UUID or hash).  
- **author:** User’s public key or registered alias.  
- **timestamp:** UTC ISO‑8601 date/time string.  
- **type:** Message category (e.g., `post`, `ad`, `alias_registration`, `poll`).  
- **version:** Schema version for compatibility.  
- **payment:** References a valid BTC or ETH transaction.  
- **signature:** Digital signature from the author’s private key.

### 5.2. Content Types

#### 5.2.1. Standard Post
```json
{
  "content": "Markdown-formatted content...",
  "links": ["https://example.com/resource"],
  "metadata": {
    "keywords": ["example", "post"],
    "lang": "en",
    "thread": "optional-thread-id"
  },
  "content_address": "ipfs://QmExampleHash"
}
```
- **content:** Main text in Markdown format.  
- **links:** External resource URLs.  
- **metadata:** Includes keywords, language, and optional thread information.  
- **content_address:** Hash‑based pointer (e.g., IPFS URI).

#### 5.2.2. Advertisement Message
```json
{
  "content": "Markdown-formatted advertisement content...",
  "links": [{
    "base": "https://example.com/offer",
    "refParam": "clientId"
  }],
  "metadata": {
    "campaign": {
      "name": "Campaign Name",
      "description": "Detailed campaign description",
      "targeting": {
        "regions": ["US", "EU"],

    "lang": "en"
  },
  "content_address": "ipfs://QmExampleAdHash"
}
```
- **Note:** Ad messages store additional metadata (exceeding the size limits imposed on regular or structured posts) and therefore incur higher fees. This premium fee structure drives momentum and helps fund the network while ensuring that the platform remains independent of advertiser influence.

## 6. Payment, Fees, and Economic Model

### 6.1. Supported Cryptocurrencies
- **Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)** are used exclusively for all micropayment transactions.

### 6.2. Dynamic Fee Structure
Fees are calculated dynamically using the formula:

\[
\text{Fee} = \text{BaseFee} \times \left(1 + \alpha \frac{U}{U_{\text{avg}}}\right) \times \left(1 + \beta \frac{C}{C_{\text{avg}}}\right) \times D
\]

- \(U\) = current usage; \(U_{\text{avg}}\) = average usage  
- \(C\) = current cost (e.g., average network fee); \(C_{\text{avg}}\) = average cost  
- \(\alpha, \beta\) = configurable coefficients  
- \(D\) = discount factor for staked participants

### 6.3. Archival Retrieval Fees
- **Retrieval Fees:**  
  Users who access archived posts (managed by Heritage Nodes) must pay a retrieval fee. These fees directly fund the operation and maintenance of Heritage servers, ensuring long‑term content preservation.

### 6.4. Payment Verification & Batching
- **On‑Chain Verification:**  
  ForYou Bridge nodes validate BTC/ETH transactions to ensure they meet confirmation requirements.
- **Batching:**  
  Micro‑transactions may be grouped to reduce verification overhead.

### 6.5. Incentive Mechanisms
- **Node Rewards:**  
  Heritage and Flow nodes receive a share of collected fees, with performance‑based bonuses for uptime and responsiveness.
- **Staking Benefits:**  
  Optional time‑locked staking can provide fee discounts and enhanced voting weight within the governance process.
