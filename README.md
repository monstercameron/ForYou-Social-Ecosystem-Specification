# ForYou Social Network Specification

**Domain:** [foryousocial.network](https://foryousocial.network)  
*The digital home for a personalized, decentralized experience.*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The **ForYou Social Network** is a decentralized social ecosystem built on a modern void‑casting model. Users post content into a global “void” where sophisticated AI agents crawl the metadata and surface relevant posts—much like a personalized public timeline. Key highlights include:

- **Micropayment-Driven Operations:**  
  Posting, archival retrieval, and advertisement submissions require on‑chain micropayments (Bitcoin and Ethereum only). Users pay a fee to retrieve archived posts, funding the long‑term preservation infrastructure.

- **Decentralized Architecture:**  
  The network uses IPFS‑style addressing, sharding, multi‑layer caching, and distributed metadata indexing. The full JSON post data is stored off‑chain while essential metadata is maintained on the network for rapid search and AI analysis.

- **Community Governance:**  
  The **ForYou Federation** manages protocol upgrades, fee policies, and compliance via transparent, democratic processes.

- **Ad Messages with Premium Fees:**  
  Advertisement messages, containing extended metadata, incur higher fees to help fund operations and maintain platform independence from advertisers.

- **Scalability & Reliability:**  
  Techniques such as dynamic fee adjustments, automated failover, and regional optimization ensure high‑performance and resilient operations.

---

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1. Void‑Casting Content Flow
- **Decentralized Posting:**  
  Users publish posts into a global digital “void” without a central authority.
- **AI‑Driven Discovery:**  
  Read‑only AI agents continuously crawl the metadata index to find posts matching user-defined interests and filtering rules.
- **Democratic Visibility:**  
  Content discovery is algorithmically driven based on relevance rather than centralized curation.

### 2.2. Technical Foundation
- **Content Addressing:**  
  Every post is assigned a unique, hash‑based identifier (similar to IPFS URIs) for deduplication and verification.
- **Sharding & Caching:**  
  The network shards data and employs multi‑layer caching (regional, node‑level, and local) to reduce latency.
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  The network indexes and stores metadata and references on‑chain (or via full nodes), while the actual file content (full JSON posts) is hosted off‑chain on decentralized storage systems.

## 6. Payment, Fees, and Economic Model

### 6.1. Supported Cryptocurrencies
- **Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)** are used exclusively for all micropayment transactions.

### 6.2. Dynamic Fee Structure
Fees are computed dynamically using:

\[
\text{Fee} = \text{BaseFee} \times \left(1 + \alpha \frac{U}{U_{\text{avg}}}\right) \times \left(1 + \beta \frac{C}{C_{\text{avg}}}\right) \times D
\]

Where:  
- \(U\) = current usage; \(U_{\text{avg}}\) = average usage  
- \(C\) = current cost; \(C_{\text{avg}}\) = average cost  
- \(\alpha, \beta\) are configurable coefficients  
- \(D\) = discount factor for staked participants

### 6.3. Archival Retrieval Fees
- **Mechanism:**  
  Users pay a fee to retrieve archived posts, which directly funds ForYou Heritage operations.

### 6.4. Payment Verification & Batching
- **On‑Chain Verification:**  
  ForYou Bridge nodes validate micropayment transactions using SPV techniques.
- **Batching:**  
  Micro‑transactions may be grouped to reduce verification overhead.

### 6.5. Incentive Mechanisms
- **Node Rewards:**  
  Heritage and Flow nodes receive fee shares and performance‑based bonuses (uptime, bandwidth).
- **Staking Benefits:**  
  Optional time‑locked staking offers fee discounts and enhanced governance voting weight.

---

## 7. Content Storage, Propagation, and Archiving

### 7.1. Decentralized Data Propagation
- **Content Addressing:**  
  Each post is stored as a JSON file on decentralized file storage (e.g., IPFS), receiving a unique content identifier (CID).
- **Sharding & Caching:**  
  The network shards data and employs multi‑layer caching (regional, node‑level) to reduce latency.
- **Batched Transmission:**  
  Updates are grouped to optimize propagation efficiency.

### 7.2. Long‑Term Archiving (ForYou Heritage)
- **Archival Policies:**  
  Historical post references and metadata are stored for a minimum period.
- **Retrieval Fee Model:**  
  Users pay a fee to access archived posts; fees support Heritage Node operations.
- **Redundancy:**  
  Files are pinned by multiple nodes to ensure availability and integrity.

### 7.3. AI‑Enhanced Metadata Indexing
- **Primary Metadata Index:**  
  Full nodes maintain a distributed metadata index that aggregates key searchable fields (e.g., keywords, timestamp, author, CID).
- **Index Structure:**  
  Utilizes efficient data structures such as Merkle trees and Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to enable rapid lookup and integrity verification.
- **API Exposure:**  
  Full nodes expose standardized APIs (REST or GraphQL) to enable queries and downloads of index “chunks.”

---

## 8. Metadata Index, Local Partial Chunks, and AI Processing

### 8.1. Distributed Metadata Index Service
- **Storage:**  
  Full nodes store a lightweight index containing essential fields from each post (or, in some cases, the full JSON if post sizes are small enough).
- **Hybrid Approach:**  
  - **Key Fields Only:**  
    Index stores searchable metadata (keywords, timestamp, author, CID).  
  - **Full Data on Demand:**  
    The complete JSON is stored off‑chain; the index pointer (CID) allows retrieval when needed.
- **Third‑Party Opportunities:**  
  Independent algorithm services can crawl the metadata index to build specialized indices for monetized content discovery.

### 8.2. Local Partial Chunk Retrieval
- **Client Download:**  
  Clients query full node APIs to download “chunks” of the metadata index that are relevant to their interests (e.g., recent posts, specific keywords).
- **Local Caching:**  
  These chunks are stored locally (using structures like Merkle subtrees) to enable rapid, read‑only AI scanning.
- **Synchronization:**  
  Clients update their local index via periodic pulls or event‑driven push notifications (pub‑sub model).

### 8.3. AI Scanning and Content Filtering
- **Read‑Only AI Agents:**  
  Local AI agents (or third‑party AI services) scan the locally stored metadata to identify posts that match user-defined interests or filtering rules.
- **Filtering Workflow:**  
  1. **Local Analysis:**  
     AI scans the partial metadata index to rank and filter posts.  
  2. **Selective Retrieval:**  
     For highly relevant posts, the AI uses the stored CID to request the complete JSON from the file storage layer.
  3. **Integrity Verification:**  
     Retrieved JSON files are verified by re‑computing their content hash and comparing it with the expected CID.
  4. **Final Filtering:**  
     The full content is processed to enforce any additional user‑level filtering or personalization.
- **Security & Privacy:**  
  AI agents operate in a read‑only mode, ensuring that content is only analyzed locally without modifying the global index.

## 9. Security and Compliance

### 9.1. Content and Transaction Security
- **Digital Signatures:**  
  Every message is signed to verify authorship and prevent replay attacks.
- **Transaction Validation:**  
  Payment transactions are verified on‑chain using SPV clients.

  Content-addressable storage and cryptographic hash verification ensure that data is immutable.

### 9.2. Network Integrity
- **Node Authentication:**  
  Secure, authenticated peer connections are enforced.
- **Redundancy & Cross‑Verification:**  
  Multiple nodes store overlapping data to detect and correct tampering.
- **Sybil Resistance:**  
  Economic incentives and proof‑of‑storage measures discourage malicious node behavior.

### 9.3. Legal Compliance
- **Jurisdiction‑Specific Filtering:**  
  Node operators filter out content illegal in their local jurisdictions.
- **Decentralized Moderation:**  
  Content filtering is performed locally by users without centralized reputation or censorship.
