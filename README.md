# ForYou Social Ecosystem Specification

**Domain:** [foryousocial.network](https://foryousocial.network)  
*The digital home for a personalized, decentralized experience.*

---

## 1. Core Overview

### 1.1. ForYou Network (The Protocol)
- **Description:**  
  The ForYou Network is the decentralized social protocol where users share, index, and interact with content. Rather than hosting files, it indexes links that point to externally hosted content.
- **Key Principles:**  
  - **Public Domain Content:** Every message is permanently recorded and released under a public domain license.  
  - **Micropayment-Driven Interaction:** On‑chain micropayments (via Bitcoin and Ethereum only) are required for submissions and archival retrievals, deterring spam and funding network operations.
  - **Decentralized and Resilient:** Payment batching, dynamic fee adjustment, sharding, advanced caching, and automated failover ensure high availability and scalability.
  - **No On‑Chain File Storage:** The network stores only links. Content files remain hosted externally, so the internet is not reinvented—just indexed and shared.

### 1.2. ForYou Federation (Governance & Consortium)
- **Role:**  
  The ForYou Federation is the community‑driven governing body responsible for protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, legal compliance, and overall strategic direction.
- **Governance Principles:**  
  - **Transparent, Democratic Process:** Decisions are made via on‑chain/hybrid voting systems and community discussion.
  - **Open Membership:** Developers, node operators, researchers, and community stakeholders actively participate.
- **Tagline:** "United in vision, governed by community."

### 1.3. ForYou Heritage (Archival Foundation)
- **Role:**  
  The ForYou Heritage is charged with the long‑term preservation and access to historical link data.
- **Operational Model:**  
  Managed and funded by the Federation, it uses archival retrieval fees to ensure the legacy of the network’s data endures.
- **Tagline:** "Preserving your legacy, one moment at a time."

## 3. Payment, Fee Mechanisms, and Incentives

### 3.1. Payment Verification and Batching
- **On‑Chain Verification:**  
  Nodes verify transactions on Bitcoin and Ethereum using transaction IDs (`txid`) and the required confirmations.
- **Probabilistic Verification:**  
  For low‑value transactions, probabilistic methods may be applied to reduce verification overhead.
- **Payment Batching:**  
  Multiple payment verifications are grouped together for efficiency.
- **Circuit Breakers:**  
  Automated fee adjustments occur during blockchain congestion to maintain smooth operations.

### 3.2. Dynamic Fee Adjustment and Retrieval Costs
- **Dynamic Fees:**  
  Posting fees are dynamically adjusted based on current network usage, resource demand, and blockchain conditions. Staked participants may receive discount factors.
- **Retrieval Fees:**  
  Accessing archived link data (managed by ForYou Heritage) incurs a micropayment fee that supports the archival service.
- **Conceptual Fee Formula:**

  \[
  \text{Fee} = \text{BaseFee} \times \left(1 + \alpha \frac{U}{U_{\text{avg}}}\right) \times \left(1 + \beta \frac{C}{C_{\text{avg}}}\right) \times D
  \]
  
  - \(U\) = current usage; \(U_{\text{avg}}\) = average usage  
  - \(C\) = current cost; \(C_{\text{avg}}\) = average cost  
  - \(\alpha, \beta\) = configurable coefficients  
  - \(D\) = discount factor for staked participants

### 3.3. Incentives and Anti‑Gaming Measures
- **Flat Incentive Model:**  
  All node operators share fees on an equal basis.
- **Performance-Based Rewards:**  
  Bonuses are awarded for high uptime, bandwidth, and responsiveness.
- **Specialized Node Roles & Marketplace:**  
  Nodes with specialized functions (detailed in Section 5) receive targeted incentives. A potential marketplace may be developed for premium services.
- **Referral Fraud Detection:**  
  The system monitors ad performance and automatically flags ads exhibiting fraudulent or abusive behavior.
- **Minimum Retention Requirements:**  
  Nodes must store link data for a predefined minimum period to preserve historical records.
- **Time‑Locked Staking (Optional):**  
  Participants may stake tokens (on Bitcoin or Ethereum) for fixed durations to earn increased rewards.

---

## 4. Content Storage, Propagation, and Archiving

### 4.1. Decentralized Data Propagation
- **Link Indexing & Deduplication:**  
  The network indexes and deduplicates links using content addressing (e.g., IPFS‑style URIs) while leaving file hosting to external providers.
- **Sharding & Caching:**  
  Data is sharded across nodes with multiple caching layers to ensure low latency.
- **Regional Optimization:**  
  Message propagation is optimized by geographic region.
- **Batched Propagation:**  
  Messages are batched for efficient transmission.

### 4.2. Archival of Link Data
- **Archival Policies:**  
  Link data is archived based on timestamps and retained for a minimum period before transitioning to long‑term storage.
- **ForYou Heritage:**  
  Managed by ForYou Heritage, the archival service preserves link data long term. Retrieval fees support the Foundation’s operational costs.
- **Delta Compression & Progressive Loading:**  
  Content updates are delta‑compressed and progressively loaded to improve efficiency.

### 4.3. Discoverability and Metadata
- **AI‑Driven Metadata Generation:**  
  Nodes generate detailed metadata for each message to improve searchability, categorization, and ranking.
- **Standardized Taxonomy:**  
  A common taxonomy is used across the network for content categorization.
- **User‑Defined Filtering:**  
  All content filtering is performed at the user level with local algorithms or AI. No centralized reputation or moderation is imposed.

## 5. Node Architecture, Health, and Specialization

### 5.1. Node Roles and Branding
Each node role is branded as part of the ForYou ecosystem:

- **Heritage Nodes (Storage Nodes):**  
  *Role:* Secure storage and archival of link data.  
  *Description:* These nodes ensure historical integrity and long‑term accessibility.
  
- **Flow Nodes (Relay Nodes):**  
  *Role:* Fast, efficient content relay across the network.  
  *Description:* They propagate posts and updates quickly, maintaining a smooth content flow.
  
- **ForYou Bridge (Bridge Nodes):**  
  *Role:* Cross‑chain connectivity with Bitcoin and Ethereum.  
  *Description:* These specialized nodes serve as connectors between the blockchain networks and the ForYou ecosystem.

### 5.2. Node Health Monitoring
Nodes continuously report their status using an expanded JSON schema:

```json
{
  "health_metrics": {
    "uptime": "float (percentage of time online)",
    "response_time": "ms (average response time)",
    "storage_availability": "bytes (available storage for indexing links)",
    "bandwidth_capacity": "mbps (network throughput)",
    "geographic_location": "region (reported location)",
    "peer_connections": "int (number of active connections)",
    "cpu_usage": "percentage (current CPU load)",
    "memory_usage": "bytes (current RAM usage)",
    "error_rate": "errors/hour (frequency of errors)",
    "latency_variance": "ms (variance in response time)"
  },
  "predictive_maintenance": {
    "temperature": "°C (operating temperature)",
    "fan_speed": "rpm (if applicable)",
    "hardware_degradation_index": "score (based on historical performance)",
    "predicted_failure": "timestamp or false (estimated potential failure time)"
  },
  "automated_recovery": {
    "restart_attempts": "int (number of automated restarts)",
    "last_recovery": "timestamp (time of last recovery)",
    "auto_failover": "boolean (if automated failover is active)"
  }
}
```

- **Predictive Maintenance:**  
  Nodes use real‑time and historical data (e.g., temperature trends, error rates) to forecast potential issues.
- **Automated Recovery Procedures:**  
  When critical issues are detected, nodes attempt self‑recovery (e.g., service restart, connection re‑establishment) and trigger auto‑failover to healthy peers if necessary.

### 5.3. Partition and Censorship Resistance
- **Robust Peer Discovery:**  
  Nodes use multiple bootstrapping methods (DNS seeds, DHT, and—where legally permissible—offline cache sharing) to discover peers.
- **Automated Failover:**  
  Traffic is automatically rerouted to healthy peers in case of node failure.
- **Localized Offline Cache Sharing:**  
  Offline cache sharing is implemented only in regions where it complies with local law.

## 6. Content Filtering, Moderation, and Legal Compliance

- **Local User‑Level Filtering:**  
  All content filtering and moderation is performed at the user level using personal algorithms or AI. No centralized reputation or flagging system is employed.
- **Legal Compliance:**  
  Nodes are responsible for filtering or pruning content that is illegal in their local jurisdiction in accordance with applicable laws.
- **No Centralized Moderation:**  
  The system avoids centralized reputation scores or flagging mechanisms, preserving decentralization.
